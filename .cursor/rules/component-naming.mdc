    # Component Naming
    ## Description
    Enforce that all component files use kebab-case (e.g., `my-component.tsx`).

    ## Rules
    - All component files in the `apps/web` folder  must be named using kebab-case.
    - When creating a new component file, ensure the filename uses kebab-case.
    - When renaming a component file, ensure the new filename uses kebab-case.
    - If a component file is not named in kebab-case, suggest renaming it.
